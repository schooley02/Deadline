  - üîÑ **Partially Implemented**: 125 (62.5%)
  - ‚ùå **Missing**: 75 (37.5%)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Inconsistent**: 0 (0.0%)

### Category Breakdown
1. **User Stories**: 52 requirements (0% implemented, 31% partially, 69% missing)
2. **Technical - Performance**: 65 requirements (0% implemented, 74% partially, 26% missing)
3. **Technical - Data**: 83 requirements (0% implemented, 73% partially, 27% missing)

## üîç Key Findings

### Top Implementation Gaps
The analysis identified critical missing implementations in core user-facing features:

1. **Visual Game Elements**: Category-specific zombie enemies and visual progression
2. **Task Management**: Sub-task hierarchies and priority systems
3. **Habit System**: Positive/negative habit distinctions and streak mechanics
4. **Routine Management**: Hero system and routine configurations
5. **Base Recovery**: Repair kits and shop functionality

### Strong Evidence Areas
The algorithm found substantial implementation evidence for:

- **Core Task Creation**: `createTaskItemData` function with category and priority support
- **Item Completion**: `completeItem` function handling XP and points
- **Routine Management**: `renderDefinedRoutines` function for routine display
- **Data Management**: Comprehensive data structures and storage mechanisms

## üõ† Algorithm Features

The implemented diff algorithm includes:

### 1. **Requirement Extraction**
- Automated parsing of project specifications
- User story identification with pattern matching
- Technical requirement categorization
- Feature section analysis

### 2. **Code Evidence Analysis**
- Multi-language support (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python)
- Function, variable, and selector detection
- Context-aware evidence collection
- 4,227+ pieces of implementation evidence identified

### 3. **Intelligent Matching**
- Keyword-based requirement-to-code alignment
- Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Coverage percentage calculation
- Status determination algorithm with 4 categories

### 4. **Comprehensive Reporting**
Three detailed CSV reports generated:

#### **Main Alignment Matrix** (`requirement_alignment_matrix.csv`)
- Complete requirement-to-implementation mapping
- Status, confidence scores, coverage percentages
- Evidence categorization (functions, selectors, constants)
- Implementation file identification

#### **Detailed Evidence** (`detailed_evidence.csv`)  
- Line-by-line evidence tracking
- Match scoring for individual evidence pieces
- File path and line number references
- Content snippets for context

#### **Summary Statistics** (`alignment_summary.csv`)
- Overall and category-level statistics
- Implementation rate calculations
- Status distribution analysis

## üéØ Status Definitions

The algorithm classifies each requirement using four distinct statuses:

- **‚úÖ Implemented**: Strong evidence across multiple code types (3+ pieces, 2+ types)
- **üîÑ Partially**: Some implementation evidence found (1+ pieces, 1+ types)  
- **‚ùå Missing**: No relevant implementation evidence detected
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent**: Conflicting or unclear evidence patterns

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Algorithm Components
1. **RequirementExtractor**: Parses specifications for structured requirements
2. **CodeAnalyzer**: Scans codebase for implementation evidence
3. **RequirementMatcher**: Applies matching algorithms and scoring
4. **CSVReportGenerator**: Produces comprehensive status matrices

### Matching Strategy
- **Keyword Analysis**: Domain-specific term identification
- **Name Similarity**: Textual similarity scoring  
- **Type Relevance**: Code type to requirement category mapping
- **Context Matching**: Surrounding code analysis

## üìà Business Impact

This analysis provides:

1. **Clear Implementation Roadmap**: Prioritized list of missing features
2. **Resource Allocation Guidance**: Evidence-based development planning  
3. **Quality Assurance**: Systematic requirement coverage verification
4. **Technical Debt Identification**: Partially implemented features needing completion

## üöÄ Next Steps

Based on the analysis, the development team should focus on:

1. **Core Visual Elements**: Implement category-specific zombie appearances
2. **Advanced Task Features**: Add sub-task and priority visual systems
3. **Habit Mechanics**: Build positive/negative habit distinction systems
4. **Shop & Economy**: Develop repair kit and currency management
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Complete partially implemented features
